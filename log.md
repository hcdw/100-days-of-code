### Day 40: Monday May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Read chapter 2 'Program Structure' from Eloqeunt JavaScript and completed the exercises (3). 
- Continued working on CS50 Week 1 C, completed 1 exercise (Mario). 
- Worked on a build-along style React tutorial, encountered errors that I haven't been able to resolve yet.

**Thoughts** The whole is starting to make more sense - as I study programming from different angles I'm beginning to deepen my understanding of the basic concepts. The problem sets I did today focussed on loops (for, while, do while) in C and JavaScript. Switching between syntax was a headache but I have a better sense of the shape of a loop and can pseudocode / diagram my way to a solution. The ch of Eloquent JavaScript I read also helped with this - it introduced 'control flow' and visualised the various branching paths of different loop types.

### Day 43: Thursday May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed loops section of fCC JS Algorithms and Data Structures. 
- Read MDN doc on recursion. 
- Read about the call stack. 
- Created a git repository from the terminal.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable working from the command line. Parsing code snippets is feeling more natural, as the syntax becomes more familiar.
