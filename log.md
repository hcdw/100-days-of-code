**Today's Progress**: Started Responsive Web Design on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** fCC is a really fast environment to get through material. Enjoying the process.

### Day 40: Monday May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Read chapter 2 'Program Structure' from Eloqeunt JavaScript and completed the exercises (3). 
- Continued working on CS50 Week 1 C, completed 1 exercise (Mario). 
- Worked on a build-along style React tutorial, encountered errors that I haven't been able to resolve yet.

**Thoughts** The whole is starting to make more sense - as I study programming from different angles I'm beginning to deepen my understanding of the basic concepts. The problem sets I did today focussed on loops (for, while, do while) in C and JavaScript. Switching between syntax was a headache but I have a better sense of the shape of a loop and can pseudocode / diagram my way to a solution. The ch of Eloquent JavaScript I read also helped with this - it introduced 'control flow' and visualised the various branching paths of different loop types.

### Day 43: Thursday May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed loops section of fCC JS Algorithms and Data Structures. 
- Read MDN doc on recursion. 
- Read about the call stack. 
- Created a git repository from the terminal.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable working from the command line. Parsing code snippets is feeling more natural, as the syntax becomes more familiar.

### Day 47: Monday May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued with CS50, C, problem - Cash 
- Completed fCC Basic JavaScript section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started fCC ES6 section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures

**New Concepts**: 
- Object.freeze - to prevent data mutation

### Day 48: Tuesday May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed fCC ES6 section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started fCC Regular Expressions section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started rebuilding portfolio site (using Gatsby, Sanity, Netlify)
- Used Gatsby GraphQL API to display dynamic data on site


**New Concepts**: 
- Promises
- Regular expressions - .test(), .match(), flags (i, g), wildcard (.), character classes eg (b[aiu]g)
- GraphQL

**Thoughts** 
- enjoy working with React - it is so fast and efficient 
- feeling more natural to work from command line and fix isues that arise

### Day 49: Wednesday May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued fCC Regular Expressions section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started CS50 Week 2, Arrays
- Continued rebuilding portfolio site (using Gatsby + Sanity)


**New Concepts**: 
- how to handle arrays in C
- how arrays are stored in memory
- efficient vs inefficient ways to use memory in programmes

**Thoughts** 
- interesting to see where C and JavaScript are similar and where they differ
- a lot of the inbuilt functionality / user friendliness of JavaScript isn't present in C
- so far, working in C is making me appreciate JavaScript!

### ~Day 50: Wednesday May 28, 2020~

**Today's Progress**: 
- Took a mental break from coding and did a Figma + UI Design tutorial from [Meng To](https://twitter.com/MengTo) on [designcode.io](https://designcode.io/)

**New Concepts**: 
- design system libraries in Figma
- components in Figma
- version control in Figma

**Thoughts**:
- Learnt a lot from the tutorial about how to properly set up a Figma design file - building up a design library by creating styles and components, layer/element/component naming conventions, how to work within the app in a deliberate, efficient, and methodical way. 
- Discovered a lot of new-to-me features 
- Componenet-led design in Figma pairs nicely with component-led building in React - especially with the ability to view/export CSS or JSON for design elements. Feels seamless and efficient.

### Day 50: Wednesday May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished fCC 'Regular Expressions' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Completed fCC 'Debugging' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started fCC 'Basic Data Structures' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Continued CS50 Week 2, Arrays
- Continued rebuilding portfolio site (using Gatsby + Sanity)

**New Concepts**: 
- Off-by-one-errors
- Regex - whitespace, lookaheads, capture groups

**Thoughts**: 
- the debugging challenges from fCC were intuitive to solve (so far), syntax and control flow becoming familiar enough to be able to spot possible errors

### Day 51: Monday June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued fCC 'Basic Data Structures' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Completed Problem Set 2: Readability from CS50 Week 2, Arrays
- Continued rebuilding portfolio site (using Gatsby + Sanity)

**New Concepts**: 
- compiling and debugging in C

**Thoughts**: 
- the C programme was quite challenging to make - I was able to get to the correct logic via psuedocode fairly quickly, but then getting that into a syntactically correct programme that would first compile and then deliver the correct result took about 75% of the time. (1 hour on logic, 3 hours on syntax, debugging etc).

### Day 52: Monday June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished fCC 'Basic Data Structures' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Started fCC 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' section of of JS Algorithms and Data Structures
- Continued rebuilding portfolio site (using Gatsby + Sanity)

**New Concepts**: 
- for...in statements
- Object.keys()
