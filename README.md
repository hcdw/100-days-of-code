# 100 Days of Code v.2

I started [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) on April 11th, logging progress into a fork of the [official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) by [Alex Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway). 

As commits to forked repos aren't tracked in contribution graphs, I've created a stand alone repository so I can visualise my progress over time.

My goals are:
-  complete [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) 
- [x] complete [fCC Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
-  complete [fCC JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
